MapIt
=====

MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas. It is
useful for anyone who has the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs to
find out what country, region, city, constituency, or state it lies within. Itâ€™s
also great for looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.

`mySociety <http://www.mysociety.org>`_ (the UK charity that wrote this code)
runs several public MapIts that you can use:

    * `MapIt Global <http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - global boundaries 
      from the `OSM <http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ project.
    * `MapIt UK <http://mapit.mysociety.org/>`_ - UK boundaries from various 
      sources.

The above are free for non-commercial, low-volume use.

Technical Overview
------------------

The ``mapit`` directory contains a standard `GeoDjango <http://geodjango.org/>`_
app, and the ``project`` directory contains an example GeoDjango project using
that app. Other top-level things are mostly to fit within mySociety's standard
deployment, or country specific data, one-off scripts and so on.

MapIt has been installed on Debian lenny and squeeze, and on Ubuntu from 10.04
onwards. If GeoDjango and `PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`_ run on
it, it should theoretically be okay; do let us know of any problems.

Installation
------------

MapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. Full details
are in ``INSTALL.rst``.

Country specific READMEs
------------------------

These are extensive notes for some of the countries that MapIt has been set up
to serve. These are in the ``docs`` folder:

  * UK: ``docs/README-UK.rst``
